# raytracer

A raytracer built with OpenGL that takes in .scene files to draw a scene with forward raytracing. Includes functionality to draw shadows and handle object intersections, albeit there are a few bugs regarding shadows. Demonstrations of images drawn from .scene files can be seen in the repository as "demo#.jpg".
