Feature:                                 Status: finish? (yes/no)
-------------------------------------    -------------------------
1) Ray tracing triangles                  Yes: 
                                            - Triangles are properly rendered using raytracing. 

2) Ray tracing sphere                     Yes: 
                                            - Spheres are properly rendered using raytracing. 

3) Triangle Phong Shading                 Yes:
                                            -Basic triangle phong shading works correctly (excluding shadows). 

4) Sphere Phong Shading                   Yes: 
                                            - Basic sphere phong shading works correctly (excluding shadows). 

5) Shadows rays                           Yes, but a bug: 
                                            - Shadows work for the most part. The spheres properly render shadows cast both by spheres and other triangles. Triangles do too in most cases. However, there's a few cases where more shadows than what are correct appear, and I wasn't able to solve that bug. Otherwise, however, shadows work as intended. 

6) Still images                           Yes: 
                                            - Still images showcasing my raytracer for each of the 5 provided example scenes are given in the folder containing this readme.
